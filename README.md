<!-- ABOUT XBITFARMS -->
## About xBitFarms

There are a lot of facts about our project that set us apart from other projects on the XRP Ledger. Here's the three biggest ones:

* We are the worlds first interactive farm based NFT project
* You own something physical that you have a shared responsibility of growing and nurturing yourself
* The wine or food product you receive from your harvested fruit will make you re-evaluate what you think is important in life
* Here's a fourth because we cant help ourselves, did we mention we're making the ownership of your tree interactive?
